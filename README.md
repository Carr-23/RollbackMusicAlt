# Rollback Music Alternative

Our God Fizzi created, Rollback Netcode for the beloved GameCube game 'Super Smash Bros. Melee'.
However, will all the greatness that came there was one small flaw which was NO-MUSIC.

Sadly, many people miss the Dreamland chants!

There is a solution however it is not the most optimal.
What RollbackMusicAlt does, is detects what stage you're playing on, and then plays the respected songs for that stage.
