# Rollback Music Alternative

Our God Fizzi created, Rollback Netcode for the beloved GameCube game 'Super Smash Bros. Melee'.
However, with all the greatness that came there was one small flaw which was NO-MUSIC.

Sadly, many people miss the Dreamland chants!

There is a solution however it is not the most optimal.
What RollbackMusicAlt does is it detects what stage you're playing on, and then plays the respected songs for that stage.

P.S. this was my first time coding in Python and was the project that I used to learn the language

## Versioning

* 0.1 -> Launch

## Authors

* **Braulio Carrion Corveira** - *Future Computer Engineer* - Outdated Site: https://carr-23.github.io/

## Future Builds
- Better UI with a custom look
- Drag and drop URL's
- Fix lag when changing input key
- Fix issue of no music playing even if detected (no idea how to fix as of now)
- RollbackMusicAlt Lite, which would include only the automated process

## Looking To Help Out?

The main things I would need help with is optimizing the code, and creating a better User interface.
